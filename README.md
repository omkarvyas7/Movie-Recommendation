# Movie Recommendation System using kNN and Cosine Similarity
To analyze the data, the first step was to import the datasets and merge them into a Pandas DataFrame. Necessary features were added, and data was visualized using Seaborn to build on the analysis. The data was then eliminated by setting a threshold, and a Pivot Table was created with users as indices and movies as columns. Finally, a kNN model was created to generate five recommendations similar to each movie.
